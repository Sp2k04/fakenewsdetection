This project is a comprehensive exploration of fake news detection using multiple machine learning techniques. I developed a model that classifies news articles as either fake or real by implementing Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest classifiers. The process involved extensive data preprocessing, including text normalization and TF-IDF vectorization, to prepare the data for model training. I then performed a comparative analysis of the classifiers to evaluate their performance and optimize the model's accuracy. The project also includes a manual testing function that allows users to input custom news articles to see how the model classifies them, providing an interactive and practical demonstration of the model's capabilities.
